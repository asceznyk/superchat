# Superchat

Superchat is a UI like [t3.chat](https://t3.chat/) or anything like that you can think of. The idea here is that this is fully open source. So anybody can build anything off this. The frontend uses React + Tailwind + ShadcnUI. The backend is currently NGINX + FastAPI + Redis.

This is a work in progress I will be adding more features soon.
